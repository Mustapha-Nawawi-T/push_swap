# push_swap

Summary:
This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an
optimized data sorting.

# To Run the Program :
 ``` make && ./push_swap "(number to sort ex(8 9 7 5 4 1 2 3))" ```
